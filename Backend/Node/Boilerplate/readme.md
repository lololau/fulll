# 🚗 Vehicle fleet parking management

I have a vehicle fleet and I want to manage where every vehicle is parked.

# About the project

I made this project as part of a technical interview.

# Getting started

## Requirements

To run this project you will need a computer with Node and Yarn.

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/lololau/fulll
```

2. Install packages:

In `Backend/Node/Boilerplate`, run:

```
$ yarn install
```

## Commands (usage)

You have to run from your terminal at the root of the backend project in `Backend/Node/Boilerplate`

1. Create user

```
$ ./fleet create-user # returns userId on the standard output
```

2. Create fleet (you will need to launch the previous command to get a userId)

```
$ ./fleet create <userId> # returns fleetId on the standard output
```

3. Register a vehicle in a specific fleet (you will need to launch the previous command to get a fleetId)

```
$ ./fleet register-vehicle <fleetId> <vehiclePlateNumber>
```

4. Add location to a vehicle

```
$ ./fleet localize-vehicle <fleetId> <vehiclePlateNumber> lat lng
```

## Running tests

Go to `Backend/Node/Boilerplate` and run:

```
$ yarn test
```

## Database

### Creation

The database is automatically created when you launch a command on your terminal.
It will create a `main.db` file in your current directory.

### Cleaning

To clean the database, simply remove `main.db` file.
You can for example run in the directory where the file exists:

```
$ rm main.db
```

## Quality code

### Formatter

To improve quality code, i use in this project **EsLint** and **Prettier**.

- **Prettier**: an opinionated code formatter
- **EsLint**: linter tool to find and fix problems

### CI process

In this project, i'm using a CI process to maintain quality and consistency.
It is helpfull to prevent regressions.

In my CI, i have two jobs:

- test: run cucumber tests
- lint: check if there is any lint issue
